Edit Code With AI 

## A Simple Open Source AI Code Editor

The premise of this project is to build and iterate an open source AI code editing system. The core idea is that you can feed this system a set of source code files and high level instructions, and it will return the edited code after some time. It aims to be compatible with many LLMs, and flexible enough to adapt to future models as they come out.
